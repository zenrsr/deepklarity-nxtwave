# Screenshots

The assignment requests three UI screenshots. Placeholder images are committed under this folder:

- `generate-tab.png` – Replace with an actual capture of the Generate tab after a successful quiz run.
- `history-tab.png` – Replace with a capture showing the history table and action buttons.
- `details-modal.png` – Replace with the quiz details modal opened from the history table.

To update:
1. Run the frontend (`npm run dev`) and backend (`uvicorn app.main:app --reload`).
2. Capture the relevant views (e.g., using the browser's screenshot tool).
3. Overwrite the placeholder PNG files with the real screenshots.

Keep filenames the same so documentation links and submission checklists stay valid.
